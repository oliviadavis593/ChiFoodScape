# ChiFoodScape: Mapping Real Food Access in Chicago

## Overview

ChiFoodScape is a civic tech project that maps and analyzes Chicago's food landscape‚Äîgoing beyond city records to expose the **real availability of full-service grocery stores, urban farms, and compost infrastructure**.

Using open data, spatial joins, and visual storytelling, the project aims to:
- Show which neighborhoods are structurally excluded from **fresh food**
- Visualize which areas are underserved by **composting and urban agriculture**
- Help residents, nonprofits, and city leaders target **food justice interventions**

## üîç Mapping Reality vs. Official Records

City datasets often lump together gas stations, dollar stores, and corner marts alongside full-service grocers‚Äîmasking real food access gaps.

ChiFoodScape filters, classifies, and reviews stores to build a **‚Äúreality map‚Äù** of Chicago‚Äôs food infrastructure, enabling targeted insights around equity and access.

---

## Current Scope

### ‚úÖ v1: Grocery Store Mapping  
- Load & clean inspection data  
- Flag real vs. junk vs. unclassified  
- Deduplicate by name/address  
- Manual edge-case review  
- **Interactive Map v1** (Folium + MarkerCluster)  
- Community-level **Choropleth** & **Access Score**  

### ‚úÖ v2: Neighborhood-Interactive Map  
- Per-community clusters with type toggles  
- GeoJSON overlay + click-to-zoom/filter  
- Custom icons for each store type  
- Configurable API key via `docs/config.js`  

---

## üß† Future Features (v3+)

- Street-network isochrone access scoring (1 mile / 20 min isochrones ‚Üí residential grid ‚Üí % coverage ‚Üí bucket into Very Low‚ÜíExcellent)  
- Overlay USDA / custom food deserts  
- Add compost sites & urban farms  
- Inspection result filtering (Pass/Fail)  
- ZIP and store-name search UI  
- Mobile-optimized, public-facing dashboard  
- On-map helper text & legends  

---

## üîó v3: Network-Based Access Scoring

In **v3**, we‚Äôll move from community-averaged counts to a **street-network coverage** model:


| Step                  | Description                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Build isochrones      | Generate 1-mile (or 20 min) walking isochrones for each store via **OSMnx** or an Isochrone API.                                  |
| Residential grid      | Sample points (~200 m) across each community polygon to approximate residential locations.                                        |
| Compute coverage      | Spatially join grid ‚Üí isochrones to identify which points fall **inside** any store‚Äôs service area.                               |
| Derive metrics        | Per community: <br>‚Ä¢ **% Covered** = covered_points / total_points<br>‚Ä¢ (Optional) Avg. network distance to nearest N stores.     |
| Bucket categories     | Threshold % Covered: <20% = Very Low, 20‚Äì40% = Low, ‚Ä¶, >80% = Excellent.                                                            |
| Visualize choropleth  | Update `07_generate_access_scores.ipynb` (or create `08_network_score.ipynb`) to render the new coverage field.                    |

> **Why this matters**  
> Instead of assuming ‚ÄúLogan Square is Excellent‚Äù because it has 22 stores, we‚Äôll surface which blocks fall outside a 1-mile walk‚Äîproof of micro-‚Äúfood deserts‚Äù in green areas.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone & install**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oliviadavis593/ChiFoodScape.git
   cd ChiFoodScape
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: Notebook Order by Output

This project includes three key visual outputs:  
üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Store Map**, üìä **Store Count Choropleth**, and üìä **Access Score Choropleth**.  

Each map relies on a chain of notebooks. Here's how to run the full pipeline:

---

### 1. Interactive Store Map  
**Output**: `grocery_stores_chicago_map_v1.html`

**Run Order**:
1. `01d_clean_grocery_stores.ipynb` ‚Üê cleans, deduplicates, and classifies stores  
2. `05_unclassified_review.ipynb` ‚Üê exports unclassified stores by community for manual review  
3. *(Manual Step)*: Review the CSVs in `data/unclassified_review/`  
4. `07_merge_unclassified_reviewed_csvs.ipynb` ‚Üê updates original dataset with reviewed labels  
5. `03_visualizations.ipynb` ‚Üê builds interactive map with color-coded clustering by store type  

---

### 2. Grocery Store Choropleth  
**Output**: `grocery_choropleth_by_area.html`

**Run Order**:
1. `04_geo_join_by_area.ipynb` ‚Üê spatial join: map stores to Chicago community areas  
2. `06_choropleth_by_area.ipynb` ‚Üê aggregates store counts & renders density map  

---

### 3. Grocery Access Score Choropleth  
**Output**: `access_score_choropleth.html`

**Run Order**:
1. `02_access_score.ipynb` ‚Üê calculates access score per area (0‚Äì4 scale)  
2. `07_generate_access_scores.ipynb` ‚Üê builds labeled choropleth using `AccessScore`  

---

### üì§ Deployment Notes
- All `.html` maps are saved to `/docs/` and served via GitHub Pages  
- After running, commit updated files in `docs/`  
- Test locally by opening `docs/index.html` or pushing live to GitHub  

---

## ü§î Framing Questions
- What does food access *actually* look like in your neighborhood?  
- How many real grocery stores are within a mile of your block?  
- Why does the city count corner stores and 7-Elevens the same as Aldi or Mariano‚Äôs?  
- Who gets access to fresh food‚Äîand who never did?  

---

## Notes
- `grocery_keywords` and `junk_keywords` are editable in `01b_clean_grocery_stores.ipynb`  
- Data transformations use **Pandas**  
- Maps are rendered with **Folium** (Leaflet.js)  
- Spatial joins and shapes rely on **GeoPandas**
