# ChiFoodScape: Mapping Real Food Access in Chicago

## Overview

ChiFoodScape is a civic tech project that maps and analyzes Chicago's food landscape‚Äîgoing beyond city records to expose the **real availability of full-service grocery stores, urban farms, and compost infrastructure**.

Using open data, spatial joins, and visual storytelling, the project aims to:
- Show which neighborhoods are structurally excluded from **fresh food**
- Visualize which areas are underserved by **composting and urban agriculture**
- Help residents, nonprofits, and city leaders target **food justice interventions**

## üîç Mapping Reality vs. Official Records

City datasets often lump together gas stations, dollar stores, and corner marts alongside full-service grocers ‚Äî masking food access gaps.

ChiFoodScape filters, classifies, and reviews stores to build a **‚Äúreality map‚Äù** of Chicago‚Äôs food infrastructure, enabling targeted insights around equity and access.

---

## Current Scope (V1): Grocery Store Mapping
‚úÖ Built:
- Loads filtered inspection data (Chicago Data Portal)
- Flags real vs. junk stores
- Deduplicates by address/name
- Allows manual classification of edge cases
- Fully reviewed unclassified stores by neighborhood
- Fully reviewed junk stores by neighborhood
- Generates interactive maps + access scores
- Exports ZIP and community area summaries

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: Notebook Order by Output

This project includes three key visual outputs:  
üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Store Map**, üìä **Store Count Choropleth**, and üìä **Access Score Choropleth**.

Each map relies on a chain of notebooks. Here's how to run the full pipeline:

---

### 1. Interactive Store Map  
**Output**: `grocery_stores_chicago_map_v1.html`

**Run Order**:
1. `01d_clean_grocery_stores.ipynb`  ‚Üê cleans, deduplicates, and classifies stores
2. `05_unclassified_review.ipynb`  ‚Üê exports unclassified stores by community for manual review
3. *(Manual Step)*: Review the CSVs in `data/unclassified_review/`
4. `07_merge_unclassified_reviewed_csvs.ipynb` ‚Üê updates original dataset with reviewed labels
5. `03_visualizations.ipynb` ‚Üê builds interactive map with color-coded clustering by store type

---

### 2. Grocery Store Choropleth  
**Output**: `grocery_choropleth_by_area.html`

**Run Order**:
1. `04_geo_join_by_area.ipynb` ‚Üê spatial join: map stores to Chicago community areas
2. `06_choropleth_by_area.ipynb` ‚Üê aggregates store counts + renders density map

---

### 3. Grocery Access Score Choropleth  
**Output**: `access_score_choropleth.html`

**Run Order**:
1. `02_access_score.ipynb` ‚Üê calculates access score per area (0‚Äì4 scale)
2. `07_generate_access_scores.ipynb` ‚Üê builds labeled choropleth using `AccessScore`


---

### üì§ Deployment Notes
- All `.html` maps are saved to `/docs/` and served via GitHub Pages
- Make sure you commit new versions of those files after running
- Test locally by opening `docs/index.html` or pushing live to GitHub

## ‚úÖ Current Status
- [x] Clean & label data
- [x] Deduplicate
- [x] Interactive map w/ tooltips
- [x] Choropleth by community area
- [x] Access score choropleth
- [x] Reviewed all previously unclassified stores
- [x] Merged reviewed store classifications
- [x] Updated all map outputs
- [x] Junk store re-review
- [ ] Real store re-review
- [ ] Food access gap analysis
- [ ] Introduce helper-text across maps for users (e.g., MarkerCluster coloring reasoning)

---

## üß† Future Features (V2+ Vision)
- Add food access scores normalized by population (per capita)
- Overlay food deserts (e.g., USDA-defined or custom)
- Incorporate compost drop-off sites and urban farms into the map
- Compare official licensing data to observed reality (spot mismatches)
- Enable inspection result filtering (e.g., Pass/Fail/Out of Business)
- Add filter and search tools to the map UI (e.g., by ZIP, store name)
- Explore mobile-optimized, public-facing dashboard version
- Integrate user-facing explanations into maps (e.g., what access scores mean, marker color logic)

---

## ü§î Framing Questions
- What does food access *actually* look like in your neighborhood?
- How many real grocery stores are within a mile of your block?
- Why does the city count corner stores and 7-Elevens the same as Aldi or Mariano‚Äôs?
- Who gets access to fresh food‚Äîand who never did?

---

## Notes
- `grocery_keywords` and `junk_keywords` are editable in `01b_clean_grocery_stores.ipynb`
- Data transformations use **Pandas**
- Maps are rendered with **Folium** (Leaflet.js)
- Spatial joins and shapes rely on **GeoPandas**
